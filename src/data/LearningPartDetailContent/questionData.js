  prompt:
    "<p>Jan Gimsa, Robert Sleigh, and Ulrike Gimsa have hypothesized that the sail-like structure running down the back of the dinosaur&nbsp;<em>Spinosaurus aegyptiacus</em>&nbsp;improved the animal’s success in underwater pursuits of prey species capable of making quick, evasive movements. To evaluate their hypothesis, a second team of researchers constructed two battery-powered mechanical models of&nbsp;<em>S. aegyptiacus</em>, one with a sail and one without, and subjected the models to a series of identical tests in a water-filled tank.</p><p>Which finding from the model tests, if true, would most strongly support Gimsa and colleagues’ hypothesis?</p>",

  explanation:
    "<p>We can simplify this hypothesis to make our lives a bit easier:</p><p><strong>Sail on back = quicker movements</strong></p><p>Which choice strengthens this idea?</p><ul><li>Choice A does focus on speed of movement, but finds that a sail on the back =&nbsp;<em>slower movement</em>. This is the opposite of what we want to support.&nbsp;<strong>We can eliminate this choice.</strong></li><li>Choice B focuses on water displacement, not the speed of movement.&nbsp;<strong>We can eliminate this choice.</strong></li><li>Choice C focuses on the power needed to move, not the speed of movement.&nbsp;<strong>We can eliminate this choice.</strong></li></ul>",
